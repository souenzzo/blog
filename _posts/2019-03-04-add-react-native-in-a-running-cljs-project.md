This tutorial will cover how to add react-native in a running cljs project.

I will flow this repo: [souenzzo/cljs-rn-tutorial](https://github.com/souenzzo/cljs-rn-tutorial/commits/master)

To run this app you need to start the repl with all profiles `clj -A:dev:cljs` then call `(user/-main)`

Generate react-native files

Createa a `app.json` file
```json
{ "name":        "cljsrn"
, "displayName": "cljs+rn"}
```

Append this in your `.gitignore`
```text
...
android/.gradle/
android/app/build/
```

run `./node_modules/.bin/react-native eject` and `git add ios app.json android`

I also do not like to commit generated files, but it is necessary `:'(`

Create a `index.js` this this template.

Then you can run `./node_modules/.bin/react-native start` and `./node_modules/.bin/react-native run-android`

To make a `./node_modules/.bin/react-native run-android`, you need to get a emulator running or a phone in the cabble
with android dev stuff configured.

Once you get the app running on android, you can edit the text, save, press `r-r` on the emulator and see the reload

Configure shadow-cljs
This commit will configure shadow-cljs and move the hello from js to cljs.

After do this, you will need to restart the REPL. That shoud be the only one restart.

Start fulcro app

I started the fulcro. Coping the code from the web and moving the dom ns to react-native.

[WIP] - I need to get the remote working.
